## **Why Are We Building This?**

Traditional file-sharing methods have major drawbacks:

- **Slow Transfers**: Large files take too much time to send.
- **Quality Loss**: Platforms like WhatsApp reduce image quality.
- **Security Risks**: Centralized services store and analyze data, compromising privacy.
- **Limited Accessibility**: Some platforms require logins, apps, or cloud storage.

**Solution:**

fileshare.io enables fast, secure, and direct P2P file transfers without a middleman, ensuring speed, privacy, and ease of use.


## **Key Features**

- **P2P File Sharing**: Direct device-to-device transfer with no middle server.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure file transfers with robust encryption.
- **10x Faster Transfer Speeds**: Uses **parallel transfers & full network bandwidth**.’
- **Pause & Resume Transfers**: Handles network issues seamlessly.
- **Offline Sharing**: Share files using a unique **one-time code**.
- **Web-Based Access**: No app required, just a simple **URL** to start sharing.


## **How It Works**

1. **User Uploads a File in route/page**
